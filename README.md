## FAQs (for future me)

 <details>
  <summary>Why use a carousel?</summary>

I did try doing everything myself, but faced issues around updating the form state and the custom animation simultaneously. Too much time was being wasted there and I thought I could easily bypass that whole shenanigan by utilizing a carousel.

 <details>
  <summary>Pros?</summary>

- Definitely less CSS and custom animations. Big W.
- No need for extra logic aside basic form controls to prevent a user from moving to the next step prematurely.

</details>

 <details>
  <summary>Cons?</summary>

- Some carousels like Alice behave unpredictably sometimes. So maybe don't use Alice.
