## FAQs <sub><sup><sub><sup><sub>(for future me)</sub></sup></sub></sup></sub>

 <details>
  <summary>Why use a carousel?</summary>

I did try doing everything myself, but faced issues around updating the form state and the custom animation simultaneously. Too much time was being spent there and I thought I could easily bypass that whole shenanigan by utilizing a carousel.

  <summary>Swiper Pros?</summary>

- Straightforward and intuitive.
- Allows you to space slides evenly through props unlike Alice.

 <details>
  <summary>Swiper Cons?</summary>

- Behaves similarly unpredictably sometimes just like Alice.
- Requires more code and logic to get the same functionality as Alice. Big L.
